\chapter{Related problems}

\section{The ordered file maintenance problem}
The \textit{Ordered File Maintenance problem} is to maintain an array of N elements in O(N)
space by having only O(1) size empty array-slot “gaps” between elements. [TODO citation Erik Demaine lec 20.]

\section{The order-maintenance problem}
The \textit{Order-Maintenance Problem} is to maintain a total order subject to the
following operations:\\

1. \textit{Insert (X, Y )}: Insert a new element \textit{Y} immediately after element \textit{X} in the
total order.

2. \textit{(Delete (X)}: Remove an element \textit{X} from the total order.

3. \textit{Order (X, Y )}: Determine whether \textit{X} precedes \textit{Y} in the total order.

We call any such data structure an order data structure. [TODO citation from Two Simplified Algorithms for Maintaining
Order in a List]\\

Notice that the Insert operation is not capable of inserting elements into an empty structure. The Order-maintenance problem is only concerned with maintaining a non-empty set of elements.


\section{List-labeling problem}
The list-labeling problem  involves maintaining explicit (e.g., integer) labels in each node of a linked list. These labels should increase monotonically over the list. The data structure needs to support insertion between two labels and deletion of a label. [TODO citation lec8]
Note that order(X, Y) can be implemented simply by comparing label(X) and label(Y) so that any solution to the list-labeling problem immediately gives one to the order-maintenance problem. [TODO citation wiki/Order-maintenance_problem#List_labeling]


\chapter{Solution A}

From  [TODO citate Two Simplified Algorithms for Maintaining Order in a List by Bender, Cole,...] with implementation details inspired by [TODO citate https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order-maintenance_problem].

\section{Solution A without indirection}

\subsection{Data structure description}

Solution A uses list-labeling to solve the order-maintenance problem.
Inserted elements are kept in a linked list, where each element has been assigned an integer \textit{tag}. The tag values are strictly increasing over the list.\\

Let \textit{n} be the current number of elements in the linked list.\\

Let \textit{N} be the number of elements in the linked list at the time of the last \textit{rebuild}. The data structure is rebuilt whenever the invariant $N/2 <= n <= 2N$ is violated.\\

Let \textit{u} be the tag universe size and a power of 2. Elements have tags from the range $[0, \textit{u}]$. Whenever we rebuild the structure, we choose a new \textit{u} that works for any \textit{n} from the range $(N/2, 2N)$.\\

\textbf{Analogy with binary tree}\\

The bits of the tags implicitly form a binary tree, which is the \textit{trie} of the bit strings. The trie has depth log(\textit{u}). Each root-to-leaf path in the trie corresponds to the bits of the tag of the reached element. This trie is called the \textit{virtual tree}.\\
When new elements are inserted into the linked list, they are assigned new tags, which translates to inserting new leaf nodes into the virtual tree.\\
Each internal node of the virtual tree identifies a sublist of the linked list elements that are stored in leaf nodes of the subtree rooted in given internal node. Each leaf node has log u such enclosing tag ranges.\\

\subsection{Insert operation \textit{Insert(X, Y)}}

When we insert an element \textit{Y} immediately after element \textit{X}, we are free to choose any tag from the range \textit{(X.tag, Z.tag)}, where \textit{Z} is the first element in the linked list right after \textit{X}.

If \textit{X} and \textit{Z} occupy adjacent leaves (their tags differ by 1), there are no available tags for the new element and we need to relabel a sublist of the linked list to make room for the new element.\\

After the insert operation is complete, we rebuild the structure if there are too many elements (see [TODO link section DATA Structure Description]).\\

\textbf{Tag-range Relabeling Algorithm}\\

When relabeling while inserting element \textit{Y} between \textit{X} a \textit{Z}, we examine the enclosing tag ranges of X, going from smaller tag ranges to larger tag ranges, until we find the smallest tag range not in \textit{overflow}. The tag ranges increase in size geometrically. We calculate the density by traversing the elements within a certain tag range (instead of walking up the implicit tree).

Let the \textit{density} of a \textit{tag range} be the fraction of occupied (already assigned) tags from the tag range.\\

A tag range is in \textit{overflow}, if its density is above the \textit{overflow threshold}, which is defined as follows:\\

Let T be a constant between 1 and 2. We calculate the threshold individually for each range based on its size:

1. For a leaf of the tree, which is a range of size $2^0 = 1$, the overflow threshold is defined as $T_0 = 1$.

2. Otherwise, for ranges of size $2^i$, $T_i = T_{i-1} / T = T^{-1}$.

We only relabel the smallest range not in overflow, even though larger tag ranges might be in overflow.

\subsection{Delete operation \textit{Delete(X)}}

When deleting an element form the linked list, we perform the standard delete operation in a linked list we also check.

After the delete operation is complete, we rebuild the structure if the number of elements is too small (see [TODO link section DATA Structure Description]).

\subsection{Order operation \textit{Order(X, Y)}}
When deciding whether X precedes Y, since tag values increase as we traverse the linked list, we simply compare the tags of elements X and Y.\\
If X has a lower tag than Y, then X precedes Y.\\
If X has a higher tag than Y, then X does not precede Y.

\section{Solution A with indirection}

\subsection{Data structure description}

The solution A as described above takes $\mathcal{O}(\log{}n)$ amortized time to update and $\mathcal{O}(1)$ worst-case time for queries. Using indirection we can improve the update to $\mathcal{O}(1)$ amortized time.\\

We split the linked list into $\theta(N/\log{}N)$ sublists, each sublist of size $\theta(\log{}N)$. This creates a two-level data structure, the bottom level being the sublists and top level being nodes representing the sublists.\\

The top level nodes form a linked list. Each node has a tag from the range $[0, N^2]$. The tags are ascending over the list, and the order of nodes corresponds to the original order of the sublists they represent.\\

Each element in a sublist has a pointer to the node representing its sublist.
Elements have \textit{local tags} from range $[0, N^2]$, that are ascending over their sublist.
Local tags of elements in one sublist are independent of local tags of elements in other sublists.\\

We introduce an additional invariant: after completing an update of the structure, each sublist has from $1$ up to $2\log{}N$ elements.\\

The former invariant $N/2 <= n <= 2N$ should still be maintained. Violating the invariant initializes a rebuild of the structure, meaning assigning new $N = n$ and splitting the elements from sublists into $\theta(N/\log{}N)$ sublists, each sublist of size $\theta(\log{}N)$.

\subsection{Insert operation \textit{Insert(X, Y)}}

When inserting an element \textit{Y} immediately after element \textit{X}, we first check whether the sublist of \textit{X} would have over $2\log{}N$ elements after the insertion. If invariant would be violated, we split the sublist into 2 sublists of size $\log{}N$, items in each sublist are given new local tags, and a new node representing the new sublist is inserted into the top-level linked list.\\
Then we insert Y after X in its sublist. If there is no available local tag, we relabel the subrange (see TODO link Relabeling subsection).\\
Finally, if there are too many elements, we rebuild the structure (see TODO link invariant and rebuild subsection).

\subsection{Delete operation \textit{Delete(X)}}

When deleting an element from its sublist, we also need to check, whether this operation leaves the sublist empty. If so, we remove the node representative of the empty sublist.\\

As before, if the number of elements is too small after the delete operation, we need to rebuild the structure.

\subsection{Order operation \textit{Order(X, Y)}}

When answering whether \textit{X} precedes \textit{Y}, we first solve the problem on the top-level list. We compare the tags of the nodes representing the sublists of given elements.\\
If \textit{X} is from a sublist with a lower tag, then \textit{X} precedes \textit{Y}.\\
If \textit{X} is from a sublist with a higher tag, then \textit{X} does not precede \textit{Y}.\\
If \textit{X} and \textit{Y} are from the same sublist (i.e., tags of their sublist representative nodes are the same), we compare the local tags of \textit{X} and \textit{Y}. If \textit{X} has a lower local tag, then \textit{X} precedes \textit{Y}.

: This is a table with different types of alignment.

This is a bullet list. Unlike numbered lists, bulleted lists
contain an **unordered** set of bullet points. When a bullet point
contains multiple paragraphs, the list is typeset as follows:

  * The first item of a bullet list

    that spans several paragraphs,
  * the second item of a bullet list,
  * the third item of a bullet list.

When none of the bullet points contains multiple paragraphs, the
list has a more compact form:

  * The first item of a bullet list,
  * the second item of a bullet list,
  * the third item of a bullet list.

Unlike a bulleted list, a numbered list implies chronology or
ordering of the bullet points. When a bullet point
contains multiple paragraphs, the list is typeset as follows:

  1. The first item of an ordered list

     that spans several paragraphs,
  2. the second item of an ordered list,
  3. the third item of an ordered list.
  #. If you are feeling lazy,
  #. you can use hash enumerators as well.

When none of the bullet points contains multiple paragraphs, the
list has a more compact form:

  6. The first item of an ordered list,
  7. the second item of an ordered list,
  8. the third item of an ordered list.

Definition lists are used to provide definitions of terms. When
a definition contains multiple paragraphs, the list is typeset
as follows:

Term 1

:   Definition 1

*Term 2*

:   Definition 2

        Some code, part of Definition 2

    Third paragraph of Definition 2.

When none of the bullet points contains multiple paragraphs, the
list has a more compact form:

Term 1
:   Definition 1
*Term 2*
:   Definition 2

Block quotations are used to include an excerpt from an external
document in way that visually clearly separates the excerpt from
the rest of the work:

> This is the first level of quoting.
>
> > This is nested blockquote.
>
> Back to the first level.

Footnotes are used to include additional information to the
document that are not necessary for the understanding of the main
text. Here is a footnote reference^[Here is the footnote.] and
another.[^longnote]

[^longnote]: Here's one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
belong to the previous footnote.

        Some code

    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
    line.  In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes work like
    multi-paragraph list items.

Citations are used to provide bibliographical references to other
documents. This is a regular citation~[@borgman03, p. 123]. This is
an in-text citation: @borgman03\. You can also cite several authors
at once using both regular~[see @borgman03, p. 123; @greenberg98,
sec.  3.2; and @thanh01] and in-text citations: @borgman03 [p.123;
@greenberg98, sec. 3.2; @thanh01].

Code blocks are used to include source code listings into the
document:

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <unistd.h>
    #include <sys/types.h>
    #include <sys/wait.h>
    // This is a comment
    int main(int argc, char **argv)
    {
        while (--c > 1 && !fork());
        sleep(c = atoi(v[c]));
        printf("%d\n", c);
        wait(0);
        return 0;
    }

There is an alternative syntax for code blocks that allows you to
specify additional information, such as the language of the source
code. This information can be used for syntax highlighting:

``` sh
#!/bin/sh
fac() {
  if [ "$1" -leq 1 ]; then
    echo 1
  else
    echo $(("$1" * fac $(("$1" - 1))))
  fi
}

\TeX{} comes pre-packed with the ability to typeset inline
equations, such as $\mathrm{e}^{ix}=\cos x+i\sin x$, and display
equations, such as \[
  \mathbf{A}^{-1} = \begin{bmatrix}
  a & b \\ c & d \\
  \end{bmatrix}^{-1} =
  \frac{1}{\det(\mathbf{A})} \begin{bmatrix}
  \,\,\,d & \!\!-b \\ -c & \,a \\
  \end{bmatrix} =
  \frac{1}{ad - bc} \begin{bmatrix}
  \,\,\,d & \!\!-b \\ -c & \,a \\
  \end{bmatrix}.
\] \LaTeX{} defines the automatically numbered \texttt{equation}
environment:
\begin{equation}
  \gamma Px = PAx = PAP^{-1}Px.
\end{equation}
The package \textsf{amsmath} provides several additional
environments that can be used to typeset complex equations:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item An equation can be spread over multiple lines using the
    \texttt{multline} environment:
    \begin{multline}
      a + b + c + d + e + f + b + c + d + e + f + b + c + d + e +
f \\
      + f + g + h + i + j + k + l + m + n + o + p + q
    \end{multline}

  \item Several aligned equations can be typeset using the
    \texttt{align} environment:
    \begin{align}
              a + b &= c + d     \\
                  u &= v + w + x \\[1ex]
      i + j + k + l &= m
    \end{align}

  \item The \texttt{alignat} environment is similar to
    \texttt{align}, but it doesn't insert horizontal spaces between
    the individual columns:
    \begin{alignat}{2}
      a + b + c &+ d       &   &= 0 \\
              e &+ f + g   &   &= 5
    \end{alignat}

  \item Much like chapter, sections, tables, figures, or list
    items, equations -- such as \eqref{eq:first} and
    \eqref{eq:mine} -- can also be labeled and referenced:
    \begin{alignat}{4}
      b_{11}x_1 &+ b_{12}x_2  &  &+ b_{13}x_3  &  &             &
        &= y_1,                   \label{eq:first} \\
      b_{21}x_1 &+ b_{22}x_2  &  &             &  &+ b_{24}x_4  &
        &= y_2. \tag{My equation} \label{eq:mine}
    \end{alignat}

  \item The \texttt{gather} environment makes it possible to
    typeset several equations without any alignment:
    \begin{gather}
      \psi = \psi\psi, \\
      \eta = \eta\eta\eta\eta\eta\eta, \\
      \theta = \theta.
    \end{gather}

  \item Several cases can be typeset using the \texttt{cases}
    environment:
    \begin{equation}
      |y| = \begin{cases}
        \phantom-y & \text{if }z\geq0, \\
                -y & \text{otherwise}.
      \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
For the complete list of environments and commands, consult the
\textsf{amsmath} package manual\footnote{
  See \url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/required/amsmath/amsldoc.pdf}.
  The \texttt{\textbackslash url} command is provided by the
  package \textsf{url}.
}.

\chapter{\textnormal{We \textsf{have} \texttt{several} \textsc{fonts}
  \textit{at} \textbf{disposal}}}
The serified roman font is used for the main body of the text.
\textit{Italics are typically used to denote emphasis or
quotations.} \texttt{The teletype font is typically used for source
code listings.} The \textbf{bold}, \textsc{small-caps} and
\textsf{sans-serif} variants of the base roman font can be used to
denote specific types of information.

\tiny We \scriptsize can \footnotesize also \small change \normalsize
the \large font \Large size, \LARGE although \huge it \Huge
is \huge usually \LARGE not \Large necessary.\normalsize

A wide variety of mathematical fonts is also available, such as: \[
  \mathrm{ABC}, \mathcal{ABC}, \mathbf{ABC}, \mathsf{ABC},
  \mathit{ABC}, \mathtt{ABC}
\] By loading the \textsf{amsfonts} packages, several additional
fonts will become available: \[
  \mathfrak{ABC}, \mathbb{ABC}
\] Many other mathematical fonts are available\footnote{
  See \url{http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/58124/70941}.
}.

\chapter{Inserting the bibliography}
After linking a bibliography data\-base files to the document using
the \verb"\"\texttt{thesis\discretionary{-}{}{}setup\{bib\discretionary{=}{=}{=}%
\{\textit{file1},\textit{file2},\,\ldots\,\}\}} command, you can
start citing the entries. This is just dummy text
\parencite{borgman03} lightly sprinkled with citations
\parencite[p.~123]{greenberg98}. Several sources can be cited at
once: \cite{borgman03,greenberg98,thanh01}.
\citetitle{greenberg98} was written by \citeauthor{greenberg98} in
\citeyear{greenberg98}. We can also produce \textcite{greenberg98}%
\ or %% Let us define a compound command:
\def\citeauthoryear#1{(\textcite{#1},~\citeyear{#1})}%
\citeauthoryear{greenberg98}%
. The full bibliographic citation is:
\emph{\fullcite{greenberg98}}. We can easily insert a bibliographic
citation into the footnote\footfullcite{greenberg98}.

The \verb"\nocite" command will not generate any
output\nocite{muni}, but it will insert its arguments into
the bibliography. The \verb"\nocite{*}" command will insert all the
records in the bibliography database file into the bibliography.
Try uncommenting the command
%% \nocite{*}
and watch the bibliography section come apart at the seams.

When typesetting the document for the first time, citing a
\texttt{work} will expand to [\textbf{work}] and the
\verb"\printbibliography" command will produce no output. It is now
necessary to generate the bibliography by running \texttt{biber
\jobname.bcf} from the command line and then by typesetting the
document again twice. During the first run, the bibliography
section and the citations will be typeset, and in the second run,
the bibliography section will appear in the table of contents.

The \texttt{biber} command needs to be executed from within the
directory, where the \LaTeX\ source file is located. In Windows,
the command line can be opened in a directory by holding down the
\textsf{Shift} key and by clicking the right mouse button while
hovering the cursor over a directory.  Select the \textsf{Open
Command Window Here} option in the context menu that opens shortly
afterwards.

With online services -- such as Overleaf -- or when using an
automatic tool -- such as \LaTeX MK -- all commands are executed
automatically. When you omit the \verb"\printbibliography" command,
its location will be decided by the template.

  \printbibliography[heading=bibintoc] %% Print the bibliography.

\chapter{Inserting the index}
After using the \verb"\makeindex" macro and loading the
\texttt{makeidx} package that provides additional indexing
commands, index entries can be created by issuing the \verb"\index"
command. \index{dummy text|(}It is possible to create ranged index
entries, which will encompass a span of text.\index{dummy text|)}
To insert complex typographic material -- such as $\alpha$
\index{alpha@$\alpha$} or \TeX{} \index{TeX@\TeX} --
into the index, you need to specify a text string, which will
determine how the entry will be sorted. It is also possible to
create hierarchal entries. \index{vehicles!trucks}
\index{vehicles!speed cars}

After typesetting the document, it is necessary to generate the
index by running
\begin{center}%
  \texttt{texindy -I latex -C utf8 -L }$\langle$\textit{locale}%
  $\rangle$\texttt{ \jobname.idx}
\end{center}
from the command line, where $\langle$\textit{locale}$\rangle$
corresponds to the main locale of your thesis -- such as
\texttt{english}, and then typesetting the document again.

The \texttt{texindy} command needs to be executed from within the
directory, where the \LaTeX\ source file is located. In Windows,
the command line can be opened in a directory by holding down the
\textsf{Shift} key and by clicking the right mouse button while
hovering the cursor over a directory. Select the \textsf{Open Command
Window Here} option in the context menu that opens shortly
afterwards.

With online services -- such as Overleaf -- the commands are
executed automatically, although the locale may be erroneously
detected, or the \texttt{makeindex} tool (which is only able to
sort entries that contain digits and letters of the English
alphabet) may be used instead of \texttt{texindy}. In either case,
the index will be ill-sorted.

  \makeatletter\thesis@blocks@clear\makeatother
  \phantomsection %% Print the index and insert it into the
  \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{\indexname} %% table of contents.
  \printindex

\appendix %% Start the appendices.
